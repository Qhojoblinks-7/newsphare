Introduction

The NewsSphere application is a modern news reader designed to bring real-time, accurate, and relevant news updates directly to users. Unlike traditional news platforms, NewsSphere emphasizes personalized search options and representation of African perspectives, offering a more inclusive and intuitive user experience. With a focus on accessibility and simplicity, NewsSphere offers categorized news, personalized search options, and an intuitive user interface. This application targets students, professionals, and the general public, making it easier to stay informed and connected.





2. Problem Statement
Many existing news platforms need more representation of African perspectives, personalization features, and seamless user experiences. For instance, limited category filters and lack of regional news coverage have hindered users' ability to connect with stories relevant to their interests and culture. Users often need help with overwhelming information, difficulty filtering relevant news, and non-responsive designs. NewsSphere aims to fill these gaps by providing:
Access to real-time news from trusted sources.
Customized filters to explore specific categories like Health, Education, and Technology.
A responsive and user-friendly platform accessible across devices.



3. Objectives
The NewsSphere project is designed to:
Deliver real-time, categorized news updates.
Enhance user engagement with an intuitive interface.
Provide personalized search and filtering options for efficient browsing.
Promote African representation in global news.





4. Scope of the Project
The project focuses on creating a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) with the following features:
Real-time news updates fetched from NewsAPI.
Category-based filtering (e.g., Health, Technology, Education).
A search bar for keyword-based exploration.
A responsive design is compatible with both desktop and mobile devices.
Features outside the MVP, such as offline access and user accounts, are reserved for future iterations due to the need for additional development time and resources. These features will enhance user engagement and personalization as the application grows in functionality.
